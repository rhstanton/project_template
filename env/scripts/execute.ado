* Execute Stata do file then exit, putting log file in subdirectory ./logs.
* Input do file can be passed either as "filename" or "filename.do", and
* log file will be "output/logs/filename.log".
*
* Note that running
*
* stata execute file.do
*
* at a command prompt is similar to using batch mode,
*
* stata -b file.do
*
* but allows control over the location of the log file (in batch mode,
* Stata always creates a log file in the current directory).
